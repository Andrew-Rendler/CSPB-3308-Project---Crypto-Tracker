Vision statement: 

Motivation: Our motivation behind the Crypto Tracker was to provide users with a tool to monitor the past performance
and leading indicators for a select set of cryptocurrency, including basic visualizations. Cryptocurrencies are very new
markets and we saw an opportunity to help consumers consolidate information for ease of use.

Risks to project completion:

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:

Development method: We have opted to apply agile (scrum) development process and ceremonies, as this will help us manage
this project with greater flexibility. Our goal being to implement a base set of features, but based on our ability to execute,
provide an opportunity to scope in additional features if time allows. We use a weekly sprint duration, meeting tuesday evenings at 7pm MST
for our stand up and sprint planning.

Project Tracking Software: Trello - we need a simple board to manage our stories
